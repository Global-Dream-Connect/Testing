            Global Dream Connect empowers teenagers from underserved communities
            to dream bigger and act bolder by connecting them with mentors from
            top universities around the world. At GDC, we donâ€™t prioritize by
            geography or background, only by opportunity. We give these
            opportunities a voice, a platform, and a clear path forward.
